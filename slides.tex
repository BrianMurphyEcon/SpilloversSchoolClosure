% \begin{frame}{Neighborhood effects}

% \begin{wideitemize}
%   \item Social scientists have long hypothesized that place of living directly affects the outcomes. 
  
%   \item Descriptive research has supported this idea by showing that individuals living in high-poverty areas fare worse both contemporaneously and over the long-run in terms of important outcomes such as education, criminal involvement, health, and earnings (Wilson 1987; Jencks and Mayer 1990; Brooks-Gunn et al. 1993; Sampson, Morenoff, and Gannon-Rowley 2002; Sharkey and Faber 2014)
  
%   \item Subsequent generation of neighborhood-effects studies have addressed selection bias by relying on randomized field experiments and on quasi-experimental sources of variation.

% \begin{wideitemize}
%   \item Randomized field experiments
%   \begin{itemize}
%       \item[-] US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Moving to Opportunity randomized housing mobility demonstration. A treatment group of public housing families move to lower-poverty areas by providing them with housing vouchers and mobility counseling.
%       \item[-] Older children and mixed evidence (Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007). Younger children positive effects on earnings and education (Chetty, Hendren, and Katz 2016).

%   \begin{itemize}
%       \item[-] Comparing outcomes for children whose families moved when they were different ages to understand how effects vary with the duration of time spent living in more-advantaged areas (eg., moving at age 9 vs 10).

% \begin{frame}{College Major Choice and STEM}
% %\textcolor{Blue}{\textbf{Disruption Vs Better environments}}
% \begin{wideitemize}
%   \item College major choice and its relationship with labor market outcomes has long been a topic of study for social scientists. For college graduates, major choice is often directly related to occupation choices. A number of studies have demonstrated that the choice of post-secondary field is a key determinant of future earnings, and that the demographic composition of college major choice may be a key factor in explaining
% earnings differences across demographic groups, such as by gender.
%     \item Multiple aspects has been studied: expected earnings and human capital investments and role for non-pecuniary considerations (work-family balance, parental approval, marriage market considerations).
%     \item Certain majors are of special interest. While STEM become pivotal in the US economy, the supply of STEM workers cannot keep up with industry demand. In addition, the representation of different races and genders in STEM fields is imbalanced. To address this concern, the National Science Foundation has allocated over \$1.5 billion towards enhancing the involvement of minorities in the sciences.

% When Mencius was just a little boy, his father died. Mencius’ mother, Zhǎng, had to raise Mencius all alone and they were very poor. At first, Mencius and his mother lived near a cemetery. Over time, Zhǎng noticed that her little boy was imitating the funeral directors and mourners. Even worse, he and his friends were playing with the offerings left at the graves. Determined to find a more wholesome environment for her son, Zhǎng moved near a busy marketplace. Once again, young Mencius began imitating the adults around him. He imitated the loud sales pitches of the merchants and made clay pigs to “butcher.” Again, Zhǎng set out to find a better place to raise her son. Their next home was near a school. This time, young Mencius imitated the students and teachers working hard at their studies and carrying out scholarly rituals. Finally, Zhǎng knew that she had found a proper neighborhood for her son. They were home. He grew up to be one of the most respected thinkers in the history of the world.

        \item Studies using randomized field experiments and quasi-experimental situations show that growing up in a \textit{better neighborhood} has positive effects on adulthood outcomes \begin{scriptsize} \textcolor{lightgray}{[Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007, Chetty, Hendren, and Katz 2016, Chetty and Hendren 2018]}\end{scriptsize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item How do students choose the field of study in college?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple aspects studied: expected earnings, human capital investments, and the role of non-pecuniary considerations (work-family balance, parental approval, marriage market considerations) \begin{scriptsize} \textcolor{lightgray}{[Willis and Rosen 1979, Altonji 2012, 2016, Zafar, 2013, Wiswall and Zafar 2019]}\end{scriptsize}

    There is persistence in the rate of majoring in STEM over time across regions, even among college graduates.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Neighborhood Exposure Effects}
    \begin{wideitemize}
        \item We identify causal effects of neighborhoods by analyzing exposure effects
        \item Think of an experiment randomly assigning a group of students across new places $p$ at grade $m$ for the rest of their school years. 
        \item Regress STEM choice $STEM_i$ of these students on non-moving students’ STEM choice in school district $p$ ($\overbar{STEM}_p$)
        \begin{equation}
        STEM_i = \alpha + \beta_m\overbar{STEM}_p + \theta_i.
        \end{equation}
        \item  Define exposure effects at grade $m$ as 
    $$\gamma_m =  \beta_{m+1} - \beta_{m}.$$
    \end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Estimating Exposure Effects in Observational Data}
\begin{wideitemize}
    \item We estimate exposure effects by studying students moving across school districts at different grades in observational data
    \item The choice of a neighborhood could be correlated with students’ future STEM choice
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ex. parents who move to a high STEM area may have latent ability or wealth ($\theta_i$) that produces better child outcomes
    \end{itemize}
    \item Estimating it in an observational sample yields a regression coefficient
    \begin{equation}
        b_m = \beta_m + \delta_m
    \end{equation}
    where $\delta_m$ = $\frac{cov(\theta_i, \overbar{STEM}_p)}{var(\overbar{STEM}_p)}$ is a selection effect.
\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Estimating Exposure Effects in Observational Data, Cont'd}
\begin{wideitemize}
    \item But identification of exposure effects does not require that where people move is orthogonal to students’ future STEM choices
    \item Even if where to move correlates with STEM choices, we can estimate the effects by taking advantage of timing of move.
    %Instead, requires that timing of move to higher versus lower rate areas is orthogonal to students’ potential outcomes.
    Assumption: $\delta_m = \delta$  for all m.
    \item Under this assumption, $$\gamma_m = \beta_{m+1} - \beta_{m} = b_{m+1} - b_{m}.$$
    \item Possible that this assumption could be violated
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ex: parents who move to better areas when kids are young may have better unobservables
        \item First present baseline estimates and then evaluate this assumption in detail
    \end{itemize}
\end{wideitemize}
 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Estimating Exposure Effects in Observational Data, Cont'd}
    We estimate the following equation for students moving from origin $o$ to destination $d$ in grade $m$ in birth cohort $s$:
    \begin{equation}
        STEM_i = \alpha_{osm} +  \sum_{m=1}^{12} b_mI(m_i=m) \Delta STEM_{od} + \eta X_{d} + \epsilon_{2i}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $STEM_i$: an indicator for whether the student $i$ chooses STEM majors
        \item $\Delta STEM_{od} = \overbar{STEM}_d -  \overbar{STEM}_o$: difference in STEM rates between destination and origin of non-movers.
        \item $\alpha_{osm}$: origin-by-school cohort-by-grade at move fixed effects
        \item $X_{d}$: a control vector including the BA rate of the destination.
    \end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Moving to areas where permanent residents major in STEM more (or less) $\rightarrow$ more (or less) likely to major in STEM
%     \item But $b_m = \beta_m + \delta_m$, need to recover $\gamma_m$ by using estimates of $b_m$ for all $m$.
% \end{itemize}


% \end{frame}


% \begin{frame}{Applying Empirical Approach to Study STEM Majors}
%     Building on this approach, we estimate analogous regression coefficients $b_m$ for children who move at each grade m from 1 to 12:
%     \begin{equation}
%         y_i = \sum_{m=1}^{12} b_mI(m_i=m)\Delta_{od} + \gamma_1\Delta_{od} + \gamma_2 BA_{d} + \tau_m + \kappa_{os} + \epsilon_{2i}  
%     \end{equation}
%     where $\tau_m$ is age at move fixed effects, $\kappa_{os}$ is origin-by-birth cohort fixed effects, and $BA_{d}$ is BA rate of the destination.

\begin{frame}{Linear Specification}\label{}
%Let $i$ index children. In the sample of one-time let $m_i$ denote the age at which child $i$ moves from origin CZ $o$ to destination CZ $d$. Let $\Bar{p}_d$ and $\Bar{p}_o$ denote the STEM rates in the destination and origin regions and $\Delta_{od} = \Bar{p}_d -  \Bar{p}_o$ denote the difference in STEM rates in the destination versus origin regions. After computing these variables, 
I regress an indicator for whether a student $i$ chooses STEM majors ($STEM_i$) on the measures of origin ($o$) and destination ($d$) STEM major rates ($\overbar{STEM}$) interacted with the student’s age at move ($m_i$): 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:}
	  STEM_i =  \alpha_{osm} + \gamma m_i \Delta STEM_{od} + \theta \Delta STEM_{od} + \eta X_{d} + \epsilon_{3i}
    \end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta STEM_{od} = \overbar{STEM}_d -  \overbar{STEM}_o$ : difference in STEM rates in the destination versus origin regions
    \item $\alpha_{osm}$: origin STEM rate-by-grade at move-by-birth cohort, and $\theta_2$: controls including BA rate of the origin and destination.
    %\item $\beta$: When students move from one place to another with a 1\% higher rate of STEM majors and the same BA rate one year later than other moved students, a child's propensity to major in STEM changes. What's the unit?

    %\item Interpretation: moving in kindergarten from 25th percentile (0.0259) to 75th percentile (0.0539) of STEM rate-1.24 SD-would increase probability of majoring in STEM by 0.0280*4.0*13=1.4196 percentage points (35\% of the mean).

\begin{frame}{Identification Assumption}\label{}
\begin{wideitemize}
    \item Identification assumption: the potential outcomes of students moving to higher versus lower STEM areas do not vary with the grade at move.
    \item[-] This could be violated for several reasons. ex, families moving to higher areas when children are young may invest more in their children in other ways
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identifying moves that occur as part of large outflows from the same place, often caused by natural disasters or local plant closures.

\begin{wideitemize}
    \item If displacement shocks do not have direct exposure effects on children that are correlated with $\Delta_{od}$, then the assumption is satisfied. 
    \item By isolating a subset of moves caused by known exogenous shocks, we can more credibly ensure that changes in students’ outcomes are not driven by unobservable factors.
    \item Identify displacement shocks based on population outflows at the school district level. Let $K_{dt}$ denote the number of students who leave school district $d$ in year $t$ in the sample of one-time movers and $\bar{K}_d$ mean outflows over the years. We define the shock to outflows in year $t$ in school district $d$ as

\begin{frame}{So Far}\label{}
\begin{wideitemize}
    \item Various refinements of the baseline design yield evidence of exposure effects rather than selection---hard to closely match the STEM rates of non-moving students by cohort, gender, race, and specific major
    \item Conclude that my estimate of $\gamma$ $\simeq$ 0.04 is an unbiased estimate of the annual exposure effect on STEM choice. 
    \item The convergence rate of 4\% implies that students moving at grade 0 would pick up about (13 - 0) $\times$ 4\% = 52\% of the observed difference in non-movers’ STEM rate between origin and destination.
    \item Interpretation: moving in kindergarten from 25th percentile (0.0259) to 75th percentile (0.0539) of STEM rate-1.24 SD-would increase probability of majoring in STEM by 0.0280*4.0*13=1.4196 percentage points (35\% of the mean).

\begin{frame}{Takeaways}
    \begin{wideitemize}
        \item Neighborhoods shape students' choice of field of study as much as they impact their overall well-being.
        \item Occupational composition of the area is the key driver influencing the neighborhood effects.
        \item Underrepresented groups experience similar levels of exposure effects. If they had the same level of neighborhoods, about 20-40\% of the gaps would be reduced.

%The idea underlying the research design is that genetic differences in inventive ability are unlikely to lead to differences in propensities to major in across specific college majors. For instance, a child is unlikely to have a gene that codes specifically for ability to invent in modulators rather than oscillators. Under this assumption, the degree of alignment between the specific technology classes in which children and their parents innovate can be used to estimate causal exposure effects.

What if the average neighborhood STEM occupation rates for underrepresented groups increase to match those of other groups?
\begin{wideitemize}
    \item The average neighborhood STEM occupations of White students (0.084) is 39\% higher than that of Black students (0.073) and 30\% more than Hispanic students (0.059)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The same neighborhood exposure rate as White neighborhoods in 13 years, Black students would increase the probability of majoring in STEM by (0.084-0.073)*13*2.6=0.37 percentage points, 12\% of the gap. 
        \item Hispanic students would increase the probability of majoring in STEM by (0.084-0.059)*13*2.6=0.85 percentage points, 39\% of the gap. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item The average neighborhood STEM occupations of not-disadvantaged students  (0.086) is 41\% higher than that of disadvantaged (0.061)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The same neighborhood exposure rate as non-disadvantaged neighborhoods in 13 years, economically disadvantaged students would increase the probability of majoring in STEM by (0.086-0.061)*13*2.6=0.85 percentage points, 22\% of the gap.

\begin{frame}{Counterfactual 2: Same Gender Exposure}\label{counterfactual2_occ}
While male and female students may live in the same neighborhoods, the proportion of students pursuing STEM differs by gender, which is critical in light of the own gender convergence.
What if the average neighborhood STEM occupation rates for female students increased to match those of male students?
\begin{wideitemize}
    \item Average neighborhood male-to-male exposure (0.082) are 28\% more than women (0.064)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The same exposure rate as men in 13 years, women would increase the probability of majoring in STEM by (0.082-0.064)*13*(1.8-0.2)=0.37 percentage points, 23\% of the gap.
